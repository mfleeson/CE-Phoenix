const HEADING_DESCRIPTION = "Product links allow you to display other products on the product info page. i.e. You might group fruit together so if you view an orange, it's linked with Pears and Limes. Links can be one way or two ways, one way means you view an Orange and it shows Lemons as a linked product but if you click through to Lemons it doesn't show oranges. This was written to allow me to sell a single book and then a 5 pack, 10 pack, 25 pack of the same books but at different discount levels. Customers view the single book but see the discounted bundles and often choose those instead.";
